- [ ] Data Cleaning
    - [ ] Beautify plots 
    - [ ] Code cleanup
    - [ ] Review code documentation in notebooks
    - [ ] Look into TCE columns - how to assign these values? [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] error - find the %error with column, replace with median % error [OPTIONAL]

- [ ] Visualisation
    - [ ] Label based
        - [ ] subset of dataset [label == CONFIRMED], plot above graphs with subset
        - [ ] density plot with subset which is confirmed
    - [ ] q-q, p-p plots [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] 3D plots [OPTIONAL]

- [ ] Prediction
    - [ ] Cross Validation
    - [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning
    - [ ] Feature Selection [FOR LATER]

- [ ] Further Analysis
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED exoplanets with planets in solar system, find closest matching planets (find metric of comparison - euclidean?, cosine?)
    - [ ] Cluster CONFIRMED exoplanets, find similar groups
    - [ ] Classify/Cluster CONFIRMED into type of planet - terrestrial, gas giant, super earth, neptune like, unknown
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED exoplanets with actual habitable planets, compare values
    - [ ] Build model to predict if planet is habitable or not, test on CONFIRMED set - find number habitable [FOR LATER]
    - [ ] subset df into CONFIRMED, plot previous plot and add markers for known planets/habitable planets [FOR LATER]
    - [ ] Comparisons with earth - https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html - make plots and show earth values?
