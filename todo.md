- [ ] Data Cleaning
    - [ ] Beautify plots [MANDATORY - PLOTS IN PAPER, OPTIONAL - REMAINING]
    - [ ] Code cleanup [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] Review code documentation in notebooks [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] Look into TCE columns - how to assign these values? [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] error - find the %error with column, replace with median % error [OPTIONAL]

- [ ] Visualisation
    - [ ] Label based
        - [ ] subset of dataset [label == CONFIRMED], plot above graphs with subset
        - [ ] density plot with subset which is confirmed
    - [ ] q-q, p-p plots [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] 3D plots [OPTIONAL]
    - [ ] PCA variance distribution
    - [ ] Cute looking correlation plot
    - [ ] count of planets discovered and method
    - [ ] Comparisons with earth - https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html - make plots and show earth values?
 
- [ ] Prediction
    - [ ] Cross Validation
    - [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning
    - [ ] Feature Selection [FOR LATER]
    - [ ] Use PCA to check if columns are related - then use those columns
    - [ ] RF (or other model) - get importance of features

- [ ] Further Analysis
    - [ ] Cluster CONFIRMED exoplanets, find similar groups
    - [ ] Classify/Cluster CONFIRMED into type of planet - terrestrial, gas giant, super earth, neptune like, unknown
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED exoplanets with planets in solar system, find closest matching planets (hassle looking for data - NO)
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED exoplanets with actual habitable planets, compare values (hassle looking for data)
    - [ ] Build model to predict if planet is habitable or not, test on CONFIRMED set - find number habitable [NO]
    - [ ] subset df into CONFIRMED, plot previous plot and add markers for known planets/habitable planets [NO]
