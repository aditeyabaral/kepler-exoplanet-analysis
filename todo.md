## MANDATORY

- [ ] Data Cleaning
    - [ ] Beautify plots for final paper

- [ ] Visualisation
    - [ ] Label based
        - [ ] subset of dataset [label == CONFIRMED], plot above graphs with subset
        - [ ] density plot with subset which is confirmed
    - [ ] [Count of planets discovered and method](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html)
    - [ ] [Comparisons with Earth](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html)
 
- [ ] Prediction
    - [ ] Neural Network
    - [ ] Plot importance of features
        - [ ] Neural Network - [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45361559/feature-importance-chart-in-neural-network-using-keras-in-python) or [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/261008/deep-learning-how-do-i-know-which-variables-are-important)

- [ ] Further Analysis
    - [ ] Cluster CONFIRMED exoplanets, find similar groups
        - [ ] Try to group into terrestrial, gas giant, super earth, neptune like, unknown

- [ ] Paper

## OPTIONAL

- [ ] Data Cleaning
    - [ ] errors - find the % error with column, replace with median % error
    - [ ] Code cleanup in notebooks
    - [ ] Review code documentation in notebooks

- [ ] Visualisation
    - [ ] q-q
    - [ ] p-p plots
    - [ ] 3D plots
    - [ ] Compare confirmed exoplanets with Earth values

- [ ] Analysis
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED exoplanets with actual habitable planets, compare values (no data)
        - [ ] Build model to predict if planet is habitable or not, test on CONFIRMED set - find number habitable
    - [ ] Compare CONFIRMED with planets in our solar system, compare values (no data)
        - [ ] Find solar system planets closest to planets in dataset
